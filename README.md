Red Dragon AI: Foundations of Deep Learning Project

For the RDAI: Foundations of Deep Learning Project, my focus will be on evaluating the effectiveness of deep learning models in classifying human emotions based on facial expression images.

The dataset that I will be using is a subset of the AffectNet dataset, sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mstjebashazida/affectnet

This subset includes 28,175 color images, each sized at 96x96 pixels.

The dataset is categorized into 8 emotion classes:

1.   Anger
2.   Contempt
3.   Disgust
4.   Fear
5.   Happiness
6.   Neutral
7.   Sadness
8.   Surprise

For the experiment, 22,540 images will be allocated for training, 2,817 for validation, and 2,818 for testing.
